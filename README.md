# Pluralsight Courses 
A collection of course materials / exercises from courses I have done - see the branches.


## To start a new course 
1. Create a new oprhan branch `git checkout  --orphan <new_branch_name>`
2. Remove existing files: `git rm -rf .`
3. Set Upstream: `git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch_name>`
